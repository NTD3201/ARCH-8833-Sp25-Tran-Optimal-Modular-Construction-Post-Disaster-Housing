## Project Overview

This research explores **energy-efficient, resilient, and sustainable modular housing solutions** in post-disaster contexts. It focuses on the use of **multi-objective optimization (MOO)**, **parametric design tools**, and **life cycle assessment (LCA)** to evaluate trade-offs between environmental impact, cost, construction time, and functional performance.

Natural disasters such as wildfires, earthquakes, and hurricanes displace millions globally. Our goal is to build back better ‚Äî not just fast, but smarter.

## üéØ Research Goals

- Assess the **environmental sustainability** of modular construction in post-disaster housing.
- Utilize **simulation tools** (Rhino + Grasshopper + Other tools) to optimize designs.
- Integrate **LCA** and **multi-objective optimization (NSGA-II)** to evaluate housing units.
- Develop a **decision-support framework** using AHP + Pareto Analysis.

## ‚ùì Research Questions

1. How can modular construction improve sustainability in post-disaster housing?
2. What are the key environmental indicators to assess?
3. How effective are simulation tools in optimizing performance?

## üß™ Methodology

1. **Define Decision Criteria**  
   ‚Üí Cost, Environmental Impact, Construction Time, and Functional Performance.

2. **Use Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)**  
   ‚Üí Weight criteria based on expert judgment and literature.

3. **Run Multi-Objective Optimization (NSGA-II)**  
   ‚Üí Generate a Pareto front of optimal modular designs.

4. **Simulate Energy & Carbon Footprint**  
   ‚Üí Use Grasshopper + EnergyPlus to evaluate EUI and GWP.

5. **Visualize & Select Optimal Designs**  
   ‚Üí Prioritize final designs based on AHP weights.
